//? Project Requirements
//! 1. Random Number Generation: Generate a random number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 
//! 100) at the start of each game.

//! 2. User Input: Allow the user to input their guesses.

//! 3. Feedback: Provide feedback after each guess:
//! o If the guess is too high, display "Too High."
//! o If the guess is too low, display "Too Low."
//! o If the guess is correct, congratulate the user.

//! 4. Track Guesses: Keep track of the number of guesses the user has made.

//! 5. Game Restart Option: Provide a button to restart the game, resetting the random number 
//! and guess count.

//! 6. Input Validation: Ensure that the user's input is a number within the specified range and 
//! provide an error message if the input is invalid.



//? Guess the Number Game - Project Brief
//* Introduction
//* Create a JavaScript program that simulates a Guess the Number game. The user will try to guess a 
//* randomly generated number within a specified range. The program will provide feedback after each 
//* guess and allow the user to restart the game at any time.

//? Design Considerations
//* • Structure your program with clear and modular functions (e.g., generating random numbers, 
//* validating input, providing feedback).
//* • Use meaningful variable and function names to ensure code readability.
//* • Incorporate basic styling to make the game visually appealing (optional but encouraged).
//* • Ensure intuitive and user-friendly input and restart functionality
